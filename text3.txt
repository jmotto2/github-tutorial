Quotes from Dune

"I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

"There is no escape — we pay for the violence of our ancestors."

"If wishes were fishes, we'd all cast nets"

"Mood? What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises —
no matter the mood! Mood's a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset.
It's not for fighting."
